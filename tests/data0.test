None Staurosporine has been reported to be a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C. However, we show that it inhibits the Ca2 + influx in anti-CD3 and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human CD4 + and CD8+ lymphocytes at concentrations between 1.0 and 10.0 ng/ml. None Staurosporine decreases the number of Ca2 +-positive CD4 + and CD8+ lymphocytes as well as the + influx per cell; the drug also delays the time of the maximum response to polyclonal stimulation. In addition, we demonstrate that staurosporine affects the primary Ca2 + response via inhibition of the release of the membrane-bound + from the endoplasmic reticulum in CD4 + and CD8+ lymphocytes. Binding studies of the anti-CD3 antibody to T lymphocytes indicate normal binding capacities in the presence of staurosporine . With respect to the classical scheme of T cell activation via phospholipase C, our data suggest that staurosporine may inhibit T cell activation primarily by its effect on the early Ca2 + flux signal.
