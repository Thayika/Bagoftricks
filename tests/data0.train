The predicted protein sequence shows strong homology to the other known cyclins in the central third of the protein. We show that the level of cyclin mRNA is regulated during the cell cycle, increasing during G2 phase to four time that present in G1. In G2/M phase, cyclin is associated with p34cdc2 , the human homolog of the fission yeast gene c dc2 +, and this complex has histone H1 kinase activity.

Seven CD4 + CTL clones were isolated from a healthy donor (HLA A2 A24; B8 B27 ; DRw17 DRw52a) by repeated stimulation with irradiated autologous EBV -transformed B cell lines (EBV-B). According to the HLA restriction specificity we divided CD4 + CTL clones into three subgroups: (i) DRw17-restricted + CTL clones; (ii) DRw52a-restricted + CTL clones; and (iii) the + CTL clones, of which the restriction specificity could not be assigned to products of a single HLA locus . Interestingly, DRw17-restricted CD4 + CTL clones distinguished between DRw17 and DRw18. Similarly, DRw52a-restricted CD4 + CTL clones distinguished between DRw52a, w52b, and w52c. There are four amino acids which differ between DRw17 and DRw18, whereas five differ between DRw52a and the other two alleles (DRw52b and DRw52c). The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of a human class I MHC molecule has identified the probable peptide binding site to be a cleft on the outer surface of the molecule, between two alpha-helices. On the basis of the theoretical model for HLA class II molecules, amino acid positions 26 and 28 (DRw17 vs DRw18) and amino acid positions 26, 28, and 74 (DRw52a vs the other two alleles ) lie within the "cleft." We propose that amino acid positions 26 and 28 are very important sites with regard to the recognition of antigen-MHC complex by the TCR.

The factors participating in this process, the pili, OPA proteins, and perhaps lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are subject to complex genetic changes that enable the pathogens to produce multiple variant forms of these factors. Antigenic variation of the pathogenic Neisseriae permits both, the escape from the human immune response and the interaction with different cells and tissues of the host . One of the intrinsic mechanisms of antigenic variation, i.e. genetic transformation, allows exchange and recombination of virulence genes between independent Neisseria strains in multiply infected individuals. Factors, such as IgA protease , alpha-factor, and the meningococcal capsule are attributed with further striking properties, and thus render the pathogenic Neisseriae as an excellent model for the investigation of bacterial virulence.

None Staurosporine has been reported to be a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C. However, we show that it inhibits the Ca2 + influx in anti-CD3 and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human CD4 + and CD8+ lymphocytes at concentrations between 1.0 and 10.0 ng/ml. None Staurosporine decreases the number of Ca2 +-positive CD4 + and CD8+ lymphocytes as well as the + influx per cell; the drug also delays the time of the maximum response to polyclonal stimulation. In addition, we demonstrate that staurosporine affects the primary Ca2 + response via inhibition of the release of the membrane-bound + from the endoplasmic reticulum in CD4 + and CD8+ lymphocytes. Binding studies of the anti-CD3 antibody to T lymphocytes indicate normal binding capacities in the presence of staurosporine . With respect to the classical scheme of T cell activation via phospholipase C, our data suggest that staurosporine may inhibit T cell activation primarily by its effect on the early Ca2 + flux signal.

First, for a period of 24-48 hr after rosetting, the signal transducing and activation functions of the T3/Ti T cell antigen receptor complex is paralyzed for anti-T3-induced calcium mobilization, with a concomitant decrease in proliferative response to mitogens or stimulatory anti-T3 antibodies. None Calcium mobilization through the alternate pathway of T cell activation, the T11 / CD2 SRBC receptor , was also inhibited by rosetting. Second, rosetting appears to confer a partial stimulatory signal through the T11 / CD2 pathway. Thus, 72 hr or more after rosetting, there was increased expression of the T11 (3) activation epitope , and rosetted T cells were stimulated to proliferate in the presence of anti-T11(3) antibodies alone. Moreover, they suggest a hitherto unrecognized down -regulatory effect of engaging the CD2 molecule, and provide further evidence that the T cell receptor is functionally interconnected to the activation pathway.

The present study examines the participation of CD28 and certain other T cell-surface molecules in inducing T cell responsiveness to IL-4 . Purified small high density T cells were cultured in the absence of accessory cells with various soluble anti- human T cell mAb with or without soluble anti-CD3 mAb and their responsiveness to IL-4 was studied. None of the soluble anti-T cell mAb alone was able to induce T cell proliferation in response to IL-4 . A combination of soluble anti-CD3 with anti- CD28 mAb but not with mAb directed at the CD2 , CD5 CD7 CD11a / CD18 , or class I MHC molecules induced T cell proliferation in response to IL-4 . Anti- CD2 and anti- CD5 mAb enhanced and anti- CD18 mAb inhibited this anti-CD3 + anti- CD28 mAb-induced T cell response to IL-4 . In addition, anti- CD2 in combination with anti-CD3 and anti- CD28 mAb induced modest levels of T cell proliferation even in the absence of exogenous cytokines. None IL-1 , IL-6 , and TNF were each unable to replace either anti-CD3 or anti- CD28 mAb in the induction of T cell responsiveness to IL-4 , but both and enhanced this response. The anti-CD3 + anti- CD28 mAb-induced response to IL-4 was exhibited only by cells within the CD4 +CD29+CD45R- memory T subpopulation, and not by CD8 + or +CD45R+ naive T cells. When individually cross -linked with goat anti- mouse IgG antibody immobilized on plastic surface, only anti-CD3 and anti- CD28 mAb were able to induce T cell proliferation. These results indicate that the CD3 and CD28 molecules play a crucial role in inducing T cell responsiveness to IL-4 and that the CD2 , CD5 , and CD11a / CD18 molecules influence this process.
