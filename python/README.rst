fastText
========

`fastText <https://fasttext.cc/>`__ is a library for efficient learning
of word representations and sentence classification.

In this document we present how to use fastText in python.

Requirements
============

`fastText-predict <https://fasttext.cc/>`__ builds on modern Mac OS and
Linux distributions. Since it uses C++11 features, it requires a
compiler with good C++11 support. You will need
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ (version 2.7 or â‰¥ 3.4) and
`pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`__.

Installation
============

To install the latest release, you can do :

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install fasttext-predict

or, to get the latest development version of fasttext, you can install
from our github repository :

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/dalf/fasttext-predic.git
   $ cd fastText
   $ sudo pip install .
   $ # or :
   $ sudo python setup.py install

Usage overview
==============

You can load a model:

.. code:: py

   import fasttext
   model = fasttext.load_model("model_filename.bin")

Then, We can also predict labels for a specific text :

.. code:: py

   model.predict("Which baking dish is best to bake a banana bread ?")

By default, ``predict`` returns only one label : the one with the
highest probability. You can also predict more than one label by
specifying the parameter ``k``:

.. code:: py

   model.predict("Which baking dish is best to bake a banana bread ?", k=3)

If you want to predict more than one sentence you can pass an array of
strings :

.. code:: py

   model.predict(["Which baking dish is best to bake a banana bread ?", "Why not put knives in the dishwasher?"], k=3)

For more information about text classification usage of fasttext, you
can refer to our `text classification
tutorial <https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html>`__.

IMPORTANT: Preprocessing data / encoding conventions
----------------------------------------------------

In general it is important to properly preprocess your data. In
particular our example scripts in the `root
folder <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText>`__ do this.

fastText assumes UTF-8 encoded text. All text must be `unicode for
Python2 <https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#unicode>`__
and `str for
Python3 <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#textseq>`__.
The passed text will be `encoded as UTF-8 by
pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/master/advanced/cast/strings.html?highlight=utf-8#strings-bytes-and-unicode-conversions>`__
before passed to the fastText C++ library. This means it is important to
use UTF-8 encoded text when building a model. On Unix-like systems you
can convert text using `iconv <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv>`__.

fastText will tokenize (split text into pieces) based on the following
ASCII characters (bytes). In particular, it is not aware of UTF-8
whitespace. We advice the user to convert UTF-8 whitespace / word
boundaries into one of the following symbols as appropiate.

-  space
-  tab
-  vertical tab
-  carriage return
-  formfeed
-  the null character

The newline character is used to delimit lines of text. In particular,
the EOS token is appended to a line of text if a newline character is
encountered. The only exception is if the number of tokens exceeds the
MAX_LINE_SIZE constant as defined in the `Dictionary
header <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/src/dictionary.h>`__.
This means if you have text that is not separate by newlines, such as
the `fil9 dataset <http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata>`__, it will be
broken into chunks with MAX_LINE_SIZE of tokens and the EOS token is not
appended.

The length of a token is the number of UTF-8 characters by considering
the `leading two bits of a
byte <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Description>`__ to identify
`subsequent bytes of a multi-byte
sequence <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/src/dictionary.cc>`__.
Knowing this is especially important when choosing the minimum and
maximum length of subwords. Further, the EOS token (as specified in the
`Dictionary
header <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/src/dictionary.h>`__)
is considered a character and will not be broken into subwords.

API
===

``model`` object
----------------

``train_supervised``, ``train_unsupervised`` and ``load_model``
functions return an instance of ``_FastText`` class, that we generaly
name ``model`` object.

This object exposes those training arguments as properties : ``lr``,
``dim``, ``ws``, ``epoch``, ``minCount``, ``minCountLabel``, ``minn``,
``maxn``, ``neg``, ``wordNgrams``, ``loss``, ``bucket``, ``thread``,
``lrUpdateRate``, ``t``, ``label``, ``verbose``, ``pretrainedVectors``.
So ``model.wordNgrams`` will give you the max length of word ngram used
for training this model.

In addition, the object exposes several functions :

.. code:: python

       predict                 # Given a string, get a list of labels and a list of corresponding probabilities.
